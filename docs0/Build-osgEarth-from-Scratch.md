# Build osgEarth from Scratch
 <!--path:  osgearth/docs/source/build.md -->

If you want to contribute to the project or make local modifications, you will need to build osgEarth yourself.

## Windows Build (vcpkg)

[vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) is a package manager. It works on Windows, Linux and MacOS but works best on Windows.


### Step 1 - Clone the osgEarth repository

Pull down the source from GitHub and create a ```build``` folder for your out-of-source build. We always recommend doing an out-of-source build to avoid problems down the road!

```
mkdir osgearth && cd osgearth
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/gwaldron/osgearth.git repo
```

This will clone the repository into a folder called `repo` and pull down any submodules.


### Step 2 - Install vcpkg

First, clone and bootstrap the [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) package manager by following the instructions.


### Step 3 - Configure for GL3 or GLCORE support (OPTIONAL but RECOMMENDED)

If you want to build with OpenSceneGraph that support GL3 or GLCORE OpenGL profile, go into your `vcpkg` installation and locate the file
```
ports/osg/portfile.cmake
```
In this file, find the line
```
set(osg_OPENGL_PROFILE "GL2")
```
...and change "GL2" to either "GL3" or "GLCORE".

(Note: GLCORE is required for some platforms like MacOSX, Mesa, or VMWare).


### Step 4 - Configure your build

On Windows we provide a batch script to configure your CMake build. This can take a while since it needs to fetch and build all your dependencies:
```
cd repo
bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
```

### Step 5 - Build and install osgEarth

You can build and install osgEarth on the command line using CMake or you can open up the Visual Studio solution and build it from there. Either way, build the INSTALL target.
```
cmake --build build --target INSTALL --config RelWithDebInfo
```

### Step 6 - Set up your runtime environment

Youâ€™ll need to make sure that the vcpkg dependencies and osgEarth are in your path:
```
set PATH=%PATH%;path\to\build\vcpkg_installed\x64-windows\bin
set PATH=%PATH%;path\to\build\vcpkg_installed\x64-windows\plugins\osgPlugins-3.6.5
set PATH=%PATH%;path\to\build\vcpkg_installed\x64-windows\tools\osg
set PATH=%PATH%;[installroot]
```

Done!

## Linux Build

vcpkg is one option for building osgEarth and all the dependencies, but it is also possible to use the Linux binary repositories to install dependencies quickly.  This is based on Ubuntu but the idea is the same; install the required dependencies and compile osgEarth.  Here are the basics:

Install your compiler if you haven't already:
```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential
```
Install GDAL & GLEW:
```shell
sudo apt-get install libgdal-dev
sudo apt-get install libglew-dev
```


Build OpenSceneGraph. You can customize the `OPENGL_PROFILE` based on your needs:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph.git
cd OpenSceneGraph
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DOPENGL_PROFILE=GL3 -DOSG_GL_CONTEXT_VERSION=4.6
make -j8
sudo make install
```
or 
```shell
#--- remark: my cmds 4 ubuntu-dbg-static
git clone https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph.git
cd OpenSceneGraph

# -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS="-static" \

cmake -S. -Bbuild/ubuntu-dbg-a \
     -DOPENGL_PROFILE=GL3 \
     -DOSG_GL_CONTEXT_VERSION=4.6  \
     -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug  \
        -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF \
        -DCMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES=.a \
     -DDYNAMIC_OPENSCENEGRAPH=OFF \
     -DDYNAMIC_OPENTHREADS=OFF



## build/ubuntu  && make -j8 
cmake --build build/ubuntu-dbg-a -- VERBOSE=1 -j15 install 
```




OPTIONAL: Build Draco.  This is optional but included in case it is not available in a repo.  The -fPIC flag may be required on some platforms but not others.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/google/draco.git
cd draco
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-fPIC
make -j8
sudo make install
```



Build osgEarth. Turning off OSGEARTH_ENABLE_FASTDXT may not be necessary but left it here for platforms where it will not build.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/gwaldron/osgearth.git
cd osgEarth
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DOSGEARTH_ENABLE_FASTDXT=OFF
make -j8
sudo make install
```
or 
```sh
# ----osgEarth: my cmds 4 ubuntu-dbg-static
git clone https://github.com/gwaldron/osgearth.git
cd osgEarth
  

cmake -S. -Bbuild/ubuntu-dbg-a \
    -DOSGEARTH_ENABLE_FASTDXT=OFF \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
    -DOSGEARTH_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF \
    -DOpenSceneGraph_ROOT=/mnt/disk2/abner/zdev/nv/OpenSceneGraph/build/ubuntu-dbg-a
cmake --build build/ubuntu-dbg-a  -- -j10 
```



After a successful build, it might be necessary to set your dynamic library search path to find both OpenScenegraph and osgEarth libraries.  Check path to osgPlugins folders also.
```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/lib64
```

# Advanced Topics

## Running on Windows WSL2 with nVidia GPU
In WSL2 (I have tried Ubuntu 20 and 22), follow the previous Linux build example with this change to Openscenegraph:
Build Openscenegraph.  This sets GL profile to Core and context to 3.3 for Mesa compatibility
```
git clone https://github.com/openscenegraph/OpenSceneGraph.git
cd OpenSceneGraph
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DOPENGL_PROFILE=GL3 -DOSG_GL_CONTEXT_VERSION=3.3
make -j8
sudo make install
```
At that point, you should have all the osgEarth binaries built and installed.
Next follow this guide: [https://canonical-ubuntu-wsl.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/tutorials/gpu-cuda/](https://canonical-ubuntu-wsl.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/tutorials/gpu-cuda/#install-nvidia-cuda-on-ubuntu)

Shortcut steps but see the above link for more information.
```
sudo apt-key del 7fa2af80
wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/wsl-ubuntu/x86_64/cuda-wsl-ubuntu.pin
sudo mv cuda-wsl-ubuntu.pin /etc/apt/preferences.d/cuda-repository-pin-600
sudo apt-key adv --fetch-keys https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/wsl-ubuntu/x86_64/3bf863cc.pub
sudo add-apt-repository 'deb https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/wsl-ubuntu/x86_64/ /'
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install cuda
```
If you are on Ubuntu 23.10, there is a CUDA install problem.  This is the fix:

The libtinfo5 package isn't available in Ubuntu 23.10's default repositories yet. We can install it by adding the universe repo for Ubuntu 23.04 (Lunar Lobster).

Open a terminal window and run:
```
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
```
Add this line (adds the Ubuntu 23.04 aka "Lunar Lobster" universe repository to apt):
```
deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ lunar universe
```
Save and exit, then run:
```
sudo apt update
```
...and now the install command for CUDA should work, automatically downloading and installing libtinfo5 while installing CUDA

I did clone the CUDA samples repo and build deviceQuery which will be a quick test to make sure your GPU is recognized
```
git clone https://github.com/nvidia/cuda-samples
cd cuda-samples/Samples/1_Utilities/deviceQuery
make
./deviceQuery
```
If that successfully recognizes your nVidia GPU, you can try:
```
osgearth_version --caps

```

## Cesium-Native Support
See documentation at [here](cesium_native.md) for building osgEarth with support for cesium-native.

## How to Check for an OpenGL CORE Profile Context
Some situations require you to have an OpenGL Core Profile context.  The ability to create a core context is available when OSG is built with OPENGL_PROFILE=GL3 or GLCORE.  Environments such as Apple OSX and VMWare require it as does debugging with tools like NVidia NSight.  You can check to see if you are running with an OpenGL Core Profile by running a command like this (Windows)
```
set OSG_GL_CONTEXT_VERSION=4.6
osgearth_version --caps
```

If all went well, it should report **"Core Profile = yes"**.

You can disable the CORE profile and select a compatibility profile by setting a profile mask like so

```
set OSG_GL_CONTEXT_PROFILE_MASK=1
```

The context version and profile mask are also settable via the `osg::DisplaySettings` class in the OpenSceneGraph API.

## Tips for VMware Users

Running osgEarth in a virtual machine environment can be tricky since they usually don't have direct access to the graphics hardware by default. If you are having trouble you can try these tips.

First, build OpenSceneGraph with support for the `GLCORE` profile (see above).

Next, assess the situation with a capabilities check:

```
osgearth_version --caps
```

The output will look something like this:

```
GPU Vendor:        WMware, Inc.
GPU Renderer       Gallium 0.3 on llvmpipe
GL/Driver Version: 1.2 Mesa 11.2.0
```

If is reports a Mesa driver, and the version is less than 3.3, you will need to configure a couple environment variables to move forward (Windows):

```
set OSG_GL_CONTEXT_VERSION=3.3
set MESA_GL_VERSION_OVERRIDE=3.3
osgearth_version --caps
```

Good luck!
